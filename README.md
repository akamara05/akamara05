### Hi, I'm Aisha 👋🏽

I'm currently based in Maryland, but I grew up in the South Pacific and spent almost 3 years living in Brisbane, Australia. I'm an academically trained Economist with an interest in data analytics and data science. I'm a 2021 General Assembly Data Science bootcamp graduate who is intentional about combining both my academic training with technical programming software skills in SQL and Python. My interest in economics has led me down the path of data analytics and data science, where some of the economic models I learned during my undergraduate program at the University of Maryland, and  master's program at The University of Queensland, overlapped with those common in data science. My master’s career allowed me to enhance my skills using excel and STATA to properly utilize statistical methodology and econometric modeling such as instrumental variables (IV) and difference-in-difference analysis, to evaluate economic datasets. 

My previous career was in public accounting where I worked 6 years both in external and internal audit (consulting) for big 4 companies as well as a mid-sized firm in NYC and the DMV. This experience gave me insights across various industries particularly higher education, where I conducted several audits, at times simultaneously, of federally funded Universities and their financial aid programs. As a consultant in internal audit, my work was more varied, but what remained consistent regardless of client or industry, was the need to understand and factually document through text and visual flowcharts, the business processes of the stakeholder’s various departments. This allowed for clear evaluation, identification, and communication of potential compliance/ or operational risks to any of their existing processes. The communication and relationship building skills, as well as my ability to work within cross functional teams, will serve me immensely in any workplace or industry I am a part of.
