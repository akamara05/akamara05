### Hi, I'm Aisha 👋🏽


I'm a professional data analyst and academically trained economist currently based in Washington, DC, and I currently work as an Operations Analyst with Waymo, formerly Google's self-driving vehicle project, on their software quality team.  

My previous career was in public accounting where I worked 6 years both in external and internal audit (consulting) for big 4 companies as well as a mid-sized firm in NYC and the DMV. This experience gave me insights across various industries particularly higher education, where I conducted several audits, at times simultaneously, of federally funded Universities and their financial aid programs. As a consultant in internal audit, my work was more varied, but what remained consistent regardless of client or industry, was the need to understand and factually document, through text and visual flowcharts, the business processes of the stakeholders' various departments. This allowed for clear evaluation, identification, and communication of potential compliance/ or operational risks to any of their existing processes. The communication and relationship building skills, as well as my ability to work within cross functional teams, has continued to serve me immensely in any workplace or industry that I've been a part of.
